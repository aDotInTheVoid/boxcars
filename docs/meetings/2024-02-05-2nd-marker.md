- Focus on open challenges in C++, and emphasize how Rust lets you express more guarantees.
    - Safer programming
    - Be less in the weeds about how
- Q: What are the contributions outside of the implementation
    - Make the Rust API for when/cown

In BEng, no requirement for research, but it should still have it. Need to articulate why, and how.

Spend more time on articulation, and less time on QoI stuff.

- Contribution: Show that theirs no overhead

- Can you measure just the perf overhead of indirect de-allocation
    - Maybe, with int's & stuff.

- Additional contribution: Atomic multi-scheduling
