# Behavior Oriented Concurrency in Rust.

For an introduction to the Behavior Oriented Concurrency model, see the
[OOPSLA 2023 Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3622852). This library
aims to provide idiomatic Rust bindings to the [Verona runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/verona-rt),
as introduced in that paper.

## Current Status

This is a research project, and is at an early stage of development. It is not
ready for use outside of research.
