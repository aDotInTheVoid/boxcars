    - He'll read the final thisis
    - Reach out now, 
    - Explain to someone without much context on BoC/Verona
        - Try to explain what your doing
        - And plans for the future
    - See what we've missed
    - Their's some deadline, but it's suggested in the next 2 weeks.

- Destructors
    - use `std::mem::needs_drop` to avoid DtorThunk when not needed
    - Could try passing around dtor pointer to `std::ops::Drop`.

- Variadic number of calls:
    - Verona-rt `when` supports passing in an array of cowns
    - Can use this to only have 1 api call.
    - `dynamic-cownset.cc`

- Q's for MSR people
    - Changes for constructors
    - Changes for destructor
    - What should the Rust API look like.
    - Tue's 3pm

- More stuff to do:
    - Variadic `when`
    - Support actual closures (not just `fn`)
    - Random `async` stuff.
