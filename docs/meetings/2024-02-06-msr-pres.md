Layout/Destructor
-----------------

- Use descriptor for Dtor Pointer
- Upstreaming seems reasonable
- Bypass C++ templates, just use desciptors, no Cowns.
- Use the Cown*, not cown_ptr<T> when scheduling
- Important Files:
  - sched/cown.h
  - object/object.h
- Mathiew Parkinson, David Chisnall, Sylvan Clebsch
- Try to go into the deaper API.
- Try to document the API as you go along.

Aliasing
--------

- Some sort of CownBag
- Extend the scheduler to expose it's uniqueness info
- Port over so tests so you can play with the API.
- Theirs also was way to request a read-only view of a Cown:
  - This API is conservitive, but does work.
  - This worked with template metaprograming, which detects `const`, and then set's a flag somewhere.

Other Stuff
-----------

- Savina Benchmarks
  - Don't have tests, but show perf.
  - Savina is for actors, so doesn't exercise the full API.
